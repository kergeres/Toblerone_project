            <p class="text"> In present days, Toblerone is owned by Mondelēz, amongst other brands such as Milka and Oreo. The chocolate is still produced in Bern, Switzerland, and the packaging has stayed the iconic prism shape, with the peak of Matterhorn and the Matterhorn Bear.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, a wide variety of Toblerone products were released, like Toblerone Snowtop, Toblerone OneByOne, and Toblerone Honeycomb Crisp. The flavor Fruit &amp; Nut, which is seen as one of the classic Toblerone flavors was created in 2007.

            <p class="text">Toblerone was created in 1908 by Theodor Tobler, and his cousin, Emil Baumann in Bern, Switzerland. Emil Baumann invented the unique recept of milk chocolate with honey and almond nougat, and Tobler made the design. The prismic shape of the chocolate many believe is a symbol of the mountain Matterhorn, in the Swiss Alps, the same mountain that can be seen on the packaging, with the Matterhorn Bear.<br><br>
                The chocolate was trademarked in 1909 under the name Toblerone, a combination of Tobler’s name and torrone, wich means nougat in Italian. At the time the only Tobblerone available was Toblerone Milk. The first flavored Tobblerone was Tobler-O-Rum, created by Tobbler in 1932. .<br><br>
                The Tobler company was independent until 1970, when it merged with Suchard, the company making Milka. After the merge new Toblerone flavors and variations appeared, like Toblerone Dark (1969), and Toblerone White (1973).
                In 1982, the new Tobler and Suchard fused with the coffee company Jacobs, to create Jacobs Tobler and Suchard. In 1990 Mondelēz, called Kraft Foods Inc. at the time, bought most of Jacobs and Suchard, including Toblerone.
